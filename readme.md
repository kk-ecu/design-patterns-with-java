Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a way to structure your code in a reusable, efficient manner. Below is a brief introduction to design patterns in Java, with code examples and real-life analogies to make the concept clear.

Categories of Design Patterns:
# Creational Patterns: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms.
# Structural Patterns: These focus on class and object composition.
# Behavioral Patterns: These focus on communication between objects.

This completes the coverage of Behavioral and Structural design patterns with simple code and real-life analogies! Hereâ€™s a recap:

# Creational Patterns
1. Singleton
2. Factory
3. Builder
4. Prototype

# Structural Patterns
1. Adapter
2. Decorator
3. Facade
4. Composite


# Behavioral Patterns
1. Observer
2. Strategy
3. Command
4. Iterator
5. State
